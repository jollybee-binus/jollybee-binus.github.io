Buat lomba, kamu tinggal daftar dan lomba aja karena lomba udh dicariin, perjalanan ke venue lomba udah diurusin semua, biaya direimburse semua, dan kalo menang ada bonus tambahan dari Binus. Dan ini semua adalah default priviledgemu sebagai anggota tanpa harus bayar sepeser pun. <br><br> Terlebih, kamu juga sangat bebas berekspresi di sini.

Materi-materi dan latihan yang diberikan juga kualitasnya TOP deh. <br><br> Selain itu, di Jollybee kita juga bisa have fun bersama.

I wasn't a confident person as well and being surrounded by suppportive and amazing people boosted my confidence which helped me to better unlock my potentials. <br><br> 2. I wouldn't have traveled to many different places both abroad and cities within Indonesia. Jollybee was very generous in their funding for competitions. <br><br> And lastly, I wouldn't meet all my friends."},
